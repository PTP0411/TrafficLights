## Description:
Simple 3-by-4 Traffic Lights game
Traffic Lights, originally called Semaphore, was invented by Alan Parr. Reported years of invention/publication vary from 1985 to 1992 to 1998. We will focus on the 3-by-4 version of the game.
Each square of a 3-by-4 grid is considered to be a light, initially off. Then, players alternate, selecting a square that does not show a red light.
If the selected square's light is off, it turns on as a green light.
If the chosen square's light is green, it becomes yellow.
If the selected square's light is yellow, it becomes red and can no longer be selected.
The first player that makes three lights on in a row/column/diagonal of the same green/yellow/red color wins.
